# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions, and community channels).

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project maintainer:
- Email: tebrennan@gwu.edu

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including:
1. Correction: private or public request to stop the behavior
2. Warning: a formal warning with consequences for continued behavior
3. Temporary Ban: temporary restrictions from project interaction
4. Permanent Ban: permanent restrictions from project interaction
